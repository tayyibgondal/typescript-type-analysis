## 📝 **FIGURE CAPTIONS (Ready to Use)**

### **Figure 1**: Escape Type Additions Across Languages
"Side-by-side comparison of escape type additions in TypeScript (\texttt{any}) and C\# (\texttt{dynamic}). TypeScript shows substantially higher usage with AI agents introducing more escape types than humans in both languages. C\# developers demonstrate 10× stronger type discipline with median additions near zero."

### **Figure 2**: Agent-Specific Escape Type Operations
"Escape type operations by AI agent across TypeScript and C\#. TypeScript agents (left) show high \texttt{any} usage with all agents adding more than removing. C\# agents (right) show minimal \texttt{dynamic} usage (10× lower scale), confirming language-specific cultural differences."

### **Figure 3**: Feature Diversity by Agent
"Mean unique advanced features used per PR across all agents and both languages. AI agents from both languages use more diverse feature sets than human developers (TypeScript: 6.57 vs 4.51, C\#: 8.5 vs 5.2), confirming universal AI feature over-application pattern."

### **Figure 4**: Type Safety Feature Adoption
"Type safety feature adoption rates across TypeScript (left panel) and C\# (right panel). AI agents over-adopt dangerous assertion patterns: 4× more non-null assertions in TypeScript (19.8\% vs 0\%) and 4.4× more null-forgiving operators in C\# (20.0\% vs 4.5\%), suppressing compile-time safety checks."

### **Figure 5**: The Acceptance Rate Paradox ⭐⭐⭐
"Pull request acceptance rates reveal paradoxical cross-language patterns. In TypeScript's balanced sample (n=545 AI, n=269 human), AI achieves significantly higher acceptance (53.8\% vs 25.3\%, $\chi^2$=27.52, p<0.001). In C\#'s imbalanced sample (n=709 AI, n=44 human), humans achieve perfect acceptance (100\% vs 56.7\%). The C\# result indicates selection bias, demonstrating that sample characteristics critically affect outcome interpretation."

### **Figure 6a**: PR Status Distribution
"Detailed breakdown of PR outcomes (Merged/Closed/Open) across languages and developer types. TypeScript shows AI advantage in merge rate but high human pending rate. C\# shows human perfect merge record with zero rejections, confirming sample curation."

### **Figure 6b**: Acceptance by Individual Agent
"Agent-specific acceptance rates across TypeScript and C\#. TypeScript agents cluster around 53-56\% with human baseline at 25\%. C\# agents cluster around 50-57\% with human outlier at 100\%, confirming agent consistency within languages but cross-language sample differences."
